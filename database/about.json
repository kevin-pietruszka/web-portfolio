  "My journey as a Software Engineer began way back when I took my first programming class in High School. From there I began to love the problem solving aspect of Computer Science even if I was learning Java at the time. Since then, I have gone to school for Computer Science and have worked a few internships in various fields related to Software Development.",
  "Currently, I am trying to earn my first role as a Software Developer as a new graduate. In my free time, I have been teaching myself wondrous new technologies, such as Rust, Next.js, and Tailwindcss, and I have also been working on various projects like this portfolio or my dotfiles repo where I can display that I am a proud NeoVim user (thatâ€™s right I am one of those guys).",
  "If for some reason I am not working on the computer, I am typically playing video games or playing a sport in the great outdoors. I have played Soccer all my life and have picked up Volleyball and Disc Golf since starting college."
