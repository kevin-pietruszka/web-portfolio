My journey as a Software Engineer began in High School when I first took a programming class where I learned python and fell in love. Since then, I have graduated from Georgia Tech where I got a Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science. My coursework covered a wide range of topics such as: Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Design, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Networking, Computer Vision, Security, Graphics, Databases, Data Visualization & Analytics, Distributed Systems, and High Performance Computing. I have also done two internships where I tried to expand my knowledge in the field and gain professional experience. They can be seen in this section.
